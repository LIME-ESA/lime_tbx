LIME Toolbox - Application Layer

This package defines high-level workflows and orchestrates operations across 
different components of the LIME Toolbox. It bridges the gap between the 
business logic and the presentation layer by handling application logic, 
user interactions, and data processing flows. It encapsulates the high-level
logic and workflows of use-cases and user stories.
