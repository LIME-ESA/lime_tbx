# Analysis

The LIME Toolbox is being developed as part of ESA's project: "Improving the Lunar Irradiance Model of ESA".
Throughout its planning, development, and implementation, ESA and the LIME Team have collaboratively proposed
and refined various objectives, features and constraints. This analysis breaks down these elements to ensure
a clear, structured approach, aligning design and implementation with the project's objectives.

## Main Features

The main objectives and expected features are described in a similar fashion to user stories, which are short
descriptions written from a user point of view that focus on what the user needs.

## Requirements Elicitation

A set of requirements has been obtained from the accepted LIME functionalities and restrictions. This
set is organised into four categories based on the user story they appeal to. These categories are:
1. **Simulations**: Requirements related to User Stories 1, 2, 3 and 4.
2. **Comparisons**: Requirements related to mainly User Story 5, but also 4.
3. **Output**: Requirements related to User Story 6.
4. **System**: Requirements related to User Story 7 and also the requirements related to the general
   functioning of the toolbox, not related to any User Story in particular.

Each set is subsequently split into two subsets: functional requirements (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR).
Functional requirements specify the essential tasks a system must perform to fulfill user and business
objectives, akin to a feature checklist. In contrast, non-functional requirements outline the system's operational standards,
addressing elements such as performance, security, and user experience. Essentially, functional requirements
answer "what must be done" whereas non-functional requirements define "how it should be done".

Take into account that the requirements listed in this documentation may not fully align with
those in any previous official LIME documentation, as they are subject to changes and additions.
