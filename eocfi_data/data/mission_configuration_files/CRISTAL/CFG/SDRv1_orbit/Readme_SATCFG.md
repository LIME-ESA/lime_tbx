# Default Satellite Configuration File for CRISTAL (SRDv1 example orbit)
The Default Satellite Configuration File (filetype SATCFG)
CRT_TEST_INT_SATCFG_00000000T000000_99999999T999999_0001.EOF
is intended to be used with tools built using EOCFI that make use of
the satellite identifier XO_SAT_DEFAULT.

Starting from EOCFI SW v4.20, there is no need to use the Default Satellite Configuration File
since there is a dedicated satellite identifier (XO_SAT_CRISTAL) to initialise the satellite ID for the CRISTAL mission,
unless the orbit characteristics have changed.
